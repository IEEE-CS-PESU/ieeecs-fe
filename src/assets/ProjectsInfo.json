        "description":"This app intends to help Dementia affected individuals by tracking the fluctuations in their mood, and can also store details about them to aid them in recollection. Caregivers of such patients can use the app to maintain a photo album of the patient's life, and one can add descriptions to help patients recollect their memories.This app also features a text-to-speech function to make it more user friendly. Built for smartphone users, this app was built using Android Studio.",

It simply intends to translate sign and gestures to English words for easy communication. A create a sign detector captures hand gestures in a live feed and converts it into text by training a CNN model using machine learning algorithms. This also helps in eventually building a gesture input enabled text editor. This algorithm was built using OpenCV and Tensorflow.",

The input can be from any IoT device such as a webcam. This project made use of OpenCV libraries to implement real-time object measurement, and is a very low cost implementation.",

This algorithm performs sentence-level sentiment analysis and classifies statements based on their tones: whether positive or negative. If negative, it identifies the negative word and suggests an alternate positive/ less negative word to use. It was built using Python, Keras and Tensorflow.",
